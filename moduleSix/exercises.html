          <h3 class="title">Good Boy Invents iPup, Smartphone for Canines</h3>
          <p>
            While Spot was learning to play fetch and Rover was rescuing people
            stuck in wells, Daniel “Bark” Zhang was building the world's first
            smartphone for dogs. The iPup is a paw-friendly mobile tablet
            running Android “Beefcake”. Daniel says (through a dog translator)
            that the idea struck him while peeing on a tree.

          <h3 class="title">A Secret Balloon Store in Downtown Toronto</h3>
          <p>
            It's a quiet, unassuming building, with venetian blinds and spanish
            masonry. Only the sharpest observer would notice the occasional
            flash of colour from beyond the curtain, a glint of red and yellow
            inflatables. Alabaster's Balloonery is possibly the country's most
            understated party store, but outside appearances can be deceiving.
            Though its red-brick facade has been left unchanged since it was
            erected over 50 years ago, the interior has been renovated, bringing
            a postmodern flourish that complements the colourful party supplies
            quite nicely.

            If sitting is the new smoking, then standing desks are the new
            nicotine patches. But most standing desks cost an arm and a leg.
